This is a tutorial for posting the summary of your talk, which is based on the tutorial posted by [Chirpy](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/write-a-new-post/).

## Naming and Path

Download this template, rename it using `YYYY-MM-DD-TITLE.md`{: .filepath}, and revise the content accordingly. Put the revised file in the `_posts`{: .filepath} of the root directory.

## Front Matter

### Timezone of Date

To accurately record the release date of a post, you should not only set up the `timezone` of `_config.yml`{: .filepath} but also provide the post's timezone in variable `date` of its Front Matter block. Format: `+/-TTTT`, e.g. `-0400`.

### Tags

The number of elements in `tags` can be zero to infinity. You can put some keywords of your talk in it. For instance:

```yaml
---
tags: [FHE, PIR]
---
```

### Author Information

Override the author information of the post as follows:

Adding author information in `_data/authors.yml`.

```yaml
<author_id>:
  name: <author_name>
  # url: <homepage_of_author>
```
{: file="_data/authors.yml" }

And then use `author` to specify a single entry or `authors` to specify multiple entries:

```yaml
---
author: <author_id>                     # for single entry
# or
authors: [<author1_id>, <author2_id>]   # for multiple entries
---
```

Having said that, the key `author` can also identify multiple entries.


### Pinned Posts

You can pin one or more posts to the top of the home page, and the fixed posts are sorted in reverse order according to their release date. Enable by:

```yaml
---
pin: true
---
```

> This template is pinned so everyone can find it easily. When you post your summary, please remember to **unpin** your post.
{: .prompt-warning }

P.S. If you would like your post to stay pinned, feel free to bring it up in the reading group. Just managing expectations ;)

## Prompts

There are several types of prompts: `tip`, `info`, `warning`, and `danger`. They can be generated by adding the class `prompt-{type}` to the blockquote. For example, define a prompt of type `info` as follows:

```md
> Example line for prompt.
{: .prompt-info }
```
{: .nolineno }


## Mathematics

We use [**MathJax**][mathjax] to generate mathematics. For website performance reasons, the mathematical feature won't be loaded by default. But it can be enabled by:

[mathjax]: https://www.mathjax.org/

```yaml
---
math: true
---
```
