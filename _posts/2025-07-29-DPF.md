Abstract: Point functions are an extremely simple yet helpful class of functions where we can specify a particular input such that the function evaluates to a particular output on this input, and the function evaluates to zero on any other input. The introduction of distributed point functions (DPFs) was motivated by the goal of achieving polylogarithmic 2-server PIR, where the client would construct a point function with relevant parameters and distribute additive shares of the functionâ€™s truth table as a key to each server. To make this key short, the original construction used recursion to progressively compress the key size until it was sufficiently small. The key sizes in this original construction are quite small and we have not seen many improvements since then. However, we have seen alternatives based on DPF, such as programmable distributed point functions (PDPF), which allow a party to prepare their key in advance to be used with any particular size of point functions. This talk will discuss the original DPF construction as well as the recent advancement of PDPFs.

Open Question:
With the minimal improvements to the key size of DPF over the past decade, is it possible to prove a lower bound on this key size under certain assumptions?
PDPF is a recent construction, so what uses can be found where PDPF is helpful aside from PIR?
[LLP25] build efficient PDPF from RSA assumptions: can we get more efficiency from other assumptions as well?
