 There are three notions of Private Information Retrieval (PIR) with preprocessing, unkeyed PIR, Public-key PIR, and Secret-key PIR (sk-PIR). The previous breakthrough work [LMW23] realized the strongest flavor of unkeyed doubly efficient PIR (DEPIR), but the protocol is impractical, partly due to its large polylogarithmic storage overhead. In this new paper, the authors consider a weaker flavor of secret-key PIR, discussing its feasibility and efficiency. In terms of the feasibility, this paper gives constructions of sk-PIR from the learning Parity with Noise (LPN) assumption in a parameter regime not known to imply Public-key Encryption (PKE) or Collision Resistant Hash function (CRH), which gives evidence that PKE may not be necessary for attaining sk-PIR. In terms of efficiency, this paper gives a construction with better storage complexity based on LPN or even better efficiency based on LSN.
